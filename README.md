# Polygon zkEVM Circuit Implementation

This document describes a circuit implemented using the `pragma circom 2.0.0` language. This declarative language is widely used in cryptographic applications, particularly for zero-knowledge proofs, to define and implement arithmetic circuits.

## Overview

The circuit, named `Circom`, features three fundamental logic gates: AND, NOT, and OR. It takes two input signals (`a` and `b`) and produces a single output signal (`Q`).

### Signal Declaration

```
// Signal declaration.
signal input a;  
signal input b;  

// Intermediate signals.
signal x;
signal y;

// Output signal.
signal output Q;
```

1. **Input Signals**: `a` and `b` are the circuit's inputs.
2. **Intermediate Signals**: `x` and `y` store the outputs of the AND and NOT gates, respectively.
3. **Output Signal**: `Q` represents the final result of the circuit.

### Logic Gate Components

```
// Logic gate components.
component andGate = AND();
component notGate = NOT();
component orGate = OR();
```

The circuit uses three predefined gate components:
- **AND Gate**: Outputs `true` only if both inputs are `true`.
- **NOT Gate**: Outputs the inverse of its input.
- **OR Gate**: Outputs `true` if any input is `true`.

### Circuit Logic

```
// Circuit logic.
andGate.a <== a;
andGate.b <== b;
x <== andGate.out;

notGate.in <== b;
y <== notGate.out;

orGate.a <== x;
orGate.b <== y;
Q <== orGate.out;
```

1. **AND Gate**: Takes `a` and `b` as inputs, and its output is stored in `x`.
2. **NOT Gate**: Takes `b` as input and its output is stored in `y`.
3. **OR Gate**: Combines `x` and `y` as inputs, with its output becoming the circuit's result `Q`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm**: Install Node.js and its package manager (npm) on your system.
2. **Circom Compiler**: Required to compile the circuit file and generate the necessary intermediates.
3. **Ethereum Development Environment**: Ensure you have tools for interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

### Steps to Execute the Program

**Step 1**: Clone the [zardkat repository](https://github.com/gmchad/zardkat) to your local system.  

**Step 2**: Open the terminal, navigate to the project directory, and install the necessary dependencies using:  
```bash
npm install
```

**Step 3**: Compile the circuit file and generate the intermediary files with:  
```bash
npx hardhat circom
```

**Step 4**: Open the `input.json` file and provide input values. For example:  
```json
{
  "a": 0,
  "b": 1
}
```

**Step 5**: Configure a connection to the **Amoy Test Network** on the Polygon blockchain. Specify the required private key and other details in the `.env` file.

**Step 6**: Deploy the circuit on the Amoy network using:  
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network amoy
```

**Step 7**: Verify the proof. Once deployed, verify the results generated by the circuit to ensure accuracy.
